👨‍💻 Hi there! I'm a tech enthusiast and Java Trainer passionate about innovation and technology. Graduated in Computer Science and Engineering from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology, I've honed my skills in various programming languages, web development, and software engineering methodologies.

🌟 At Nexxvali, a prominent IT consulting firm, I've been empowering over 100 consultants in Java. Covering core and advanced topics, my training equips them to excel as proficient QA engineers. Beyond Java, I conduct comprehensive IT sessions encompassing Microsoft Office basics, web hosting, programming fundamentals, leveraging AI tools, search engine techniques, and maximizing Google services.

🏆 Alongside hands-on training, I hold certifications in professional email writing, technical support fundamentals, and time management, enhancing both personal and professional productivity.

🚀 Constantly curious and keen on learning, I actively engage in workshops and seminars to stay updated with the latest tech trends. Outside the tech realm, I'm also a musician, composing music in my leisure time, fostering creativity and innovative thinking.

🤝 Committed to networking and forging professional relationships within the industry, I'm enthusiastic about leveraging my skills and passion to create impactful, innovative solutions.
